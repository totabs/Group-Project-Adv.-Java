Sharing code that could help with the Chess Game Project

I passed all the code that I have into this repository

Feel free to use whatever portions of it you think would fit into your part of the project

As of today (02/21/2019) none of the classes are complete so please don't just copy/paste everything since it'll be trash anyway.

Just click on the "ChessGame" doc, and then where it says source ("src") to access the classes/ .java files
